# Credit Risk Classification with Machine Learning

This is a personal portfolio project that builds an ensemble credit risk classifier using the [German Credit Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/144/statlog+german+credit+data). The project demonstrates end-to-end machine learning workflow including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning and experiment tracking with MLflow. The final product is a soft voting ensemble of three classifiers optimized for a business-relevant cost function. You can try out the model via a Streamlit web application.

## Project Overview

This project predicts credit risk (good/bad) for loan applicants using three models:
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** with RBF kernel
- **Logistic Regression** with L2 regularization  
- **Random Forest Classifier**

Each model has its own preprocessing pipeline optimized for its characteristics and the final prediction uses soft voting across all three models.

### Key Features

- **Custom Feature Engineering**: Domain-specific transformations, numerical features transformations and categorizations, rare label consolidations
- **Multiple Encoding Strategies**: WOE, Target, Count and One-Hot encoding tailored per model
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: SMOTE/SVMSMOTE and cost-sensitive learning
- **Cost-Sensitive Optimization**: Custom cost function (FP=5, FN=1) reflecting real-world business impact per the dataset documentation
- **Threshold Tuning**: For individual models using `TunedThresholdClassifierCV` or fixed class balance, manual optimization for the ensemble
- **Experiment Tracking**: Full MLflow integration with metrics, parameters, artifacts and model versioning

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended) or pip

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ntinasf/credit-risk-svm.git
   cd credit-risk-svm
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   # Using uv (recommended)
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   
   # Or using pip
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Using uv
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Or using pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Reproducing the Results

### Step 1: Process Raw Data

Process the raw German Credit dataset:

```bash
python scripts/process_data.py
```

### Step 2: Split the Data

Create train/test split using stratified hash-based splitting:

```bash
python scripts/split_data.py --test-size 0.15
```

This creates `train_data.csv` and `test_data.csv` in `data/processed/`.

### Step 3: Train Individual Models

Train each model separately with MLflow tracking:

```bash
# Train SVC with hyperparameter tuning, SMOTE, and register to MLflow
python scripts/train_svc.py --tune --smote --tune-threshold --log-model

# Train Logistic Regression
python scripts/train_lrc.py --tune --smote --tune-threshold --log-model

# Train Random Forest
python scripts/train_rf.py --tune --tune-threshold --log-model
```

Available arguments for training scripts:
| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `--tune` | Enable Bayesian hyperparameter tuning |
| `--smote` | Use SMOTE for class imbalance (LRC/SVC only) |
| `--tune-threshold` | Tune decision threshold for cost optimization |
| `--log-model` | Register model to MLflow registry |
| `--cv N` | Number of cross-validation folds |
| `--val-size N` | Validation set size |

### Step 4: Score the Ensemble

Score the ensemble model and log metrics to MLflow:

```bash
python scripts/score_ensemble.py --weights 2.5 1.5 3.0 --threshold 0.63
```

This creates a new MLflow experiment (`credit-risk-ensemble`) with ensemble metrics for comparison.

### Step 5: View Experiments in MLflow

```bash
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db
```

Open http://localhost:5000 to view experiments, compare runs, and inspect artifacts.

### Step 6: Score New Data

For production scoring on new data:

```bash
python scripts/score_model.py
```

## Model Performance on test set after threshold tuning
| Model | ROC AUC | Avg Cost |
|-------|---------|----------|
| SVC (SMOTE) | ~0.81 | ~0.43 |
| Logistic Regression | ~0.80 | ~0.49 |
| Random Forest | ~0.82 | ~0.53 |
| **Ensemble** (Soft Voting) | **~0.79** | **~0.43** |

*Note: Results may vary slightly between runs.*

---

## Cost Function

The model optimizes for a business-realistic cost function as mentioned in the German Credit dataset documentation:

- **False Negative (FN)**: Rejecting a good customer = **1 cost unit** (lost business opportunity)
- **False Positive (FP)**: Accepting a bad customer = **5 cost units** (potential default loss)

---

## Technical Details

### Feature Engineering

The `FeatureEngineer` transformer applies:
- **Monthly Burden**: `credit_amount / duration_months` (log-transformed)
- **Duration Bins**: Quintile-based categorization
- **Age Groups**: Young, Early Career, Prime, Mature
- **Category Consolidation**: Merging sparse categories for better generalization

### Preprocessing Pipelines

Each model uses a tailored encoding strategy:

| Model | Encoding Strategy |
|-------|-------------------|
| SVC | WOE + Target + Count + One-Hot |
| LRC | WOE + Count + One-Hot |
| RFC | One-Hot + Count + Target |

### MLflow Artifacts

Each training run logs:
- `learning_curve.png` - Bias-variance diagnostic
- `confusion_matrix.png` - Classification results
- `precision_recall_curve.png` - PR curve with average precision
- Full pipeline model (preprocessing + classifier)

*All the above can be found in the MLflow UI under each run's artifacts.*
